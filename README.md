<h1>Welcome to the Future of Energy!</h1>
<p>A peer-to-peer energy trading platform for community micro-grids. For more on the project, visit our <a href="https://github.com/pswild/p2p-energy-dapp" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You can find a copy of the thesis explaining this project <a href="http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01wh246v999" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h3>An Ethereum Distributed Application</h3>
<p>Our system allows you to safely trade electricity with members of your micro-grid community without trusting a utility with your data. The price of electricity is set by an auction mechanism, not a central authority. The details of the auction are kept in a distributed ledger that is shared with each participant, but your consumption data and price preferences are visible only to you.</p>
<h3>UPort Authentication</h3>
<p>Set up your secure account with UPort authentication on your mobile device. In the upper-right corner, you'll see a login button. Click it to login with UPort.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The infrastructure for the generation and distribution of electricity the United States relies on fossil-fuel based power plants that are controlled by a natural oligopoly of electric utilities. The system is highly centralized, requires transmission over long distances, and is liable to disruption by natural disaster.</p>
<p> As distributed energy resources become more accessible, localized production of energy will increase grid efficiency, decrease environmental impact, and yield a more resilient energy system. The growing electric vehicle market predicts not only an increased demand for electricity, but also the creation of a battery fleet capable of balancing intermittent renewable generation.</p>
<p>We want to make renewable energy more affordable. Our goal is to develop a more efficient, environmentally-friendly, and reliable energy system in the United States by solving the problem prosumers face selling electricity back to the grid.</p>
